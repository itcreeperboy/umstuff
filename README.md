here are some notes ig:

idk how to make neofetch use the image by default so i run neofetch --kitty ~/Documents/dog.png in my bashrc


gpu name was too long in the neofetch so i replaced that row with a prin so u manually have to add ur own gpu model there
also the gpu module on my waybar is custom and only works on intel gpus, this post and comments should show how to do it on nvidia and amd maybe: https://www.reddit.com/r/swaywm/comments/ncjpfz/how_to_add_gpu_usage_to_waybar/
also you might need to grant special permissions to intel_gpu_top if you use the unedited version (so i can hack you muahahahaha)
